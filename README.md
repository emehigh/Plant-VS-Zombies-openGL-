# Plant-VS-Zombies-openGL-

An openGL implementation of a simplified version of Plant Vs Zombies.  The game featured a simplified geometric design and three rows with three columns each. In this game, hexagon-shaped enemies appeared randomly from the right side of the screen and traversed a line towards the left. The player's objective was to strategically place diamond-shaped defenders in the three cells of each row to launch projectiles and eliminate the hexagons.

The game introduced a resource system where stars appeared at random intervals, and players could collect them to deploy defenders. Each diamond defender had a specific color (orange, blue, yellow, or purple) and cost associated with placement. Defenders could only attack hexagons of the same color, adding a layer of strategy to the gameplay. Made use of concepts such as Drag & Drop, objects collision.
